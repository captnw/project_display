# About the game
"Escape the simple dungeon" is my first game made with python. This game is a simple text adventure game where you navigate a dungeon in order to reach the exit. Combat is basic and it is based on randomness (you attack and you do a random amount of damage). Each dungeon is randomly generated.

##### Why did I make this game
It was just an personal project I wanted to take on. I wanted to make my own 'game', so I made this simple project with some help from my highschool teacher Mr. Lavrov.
