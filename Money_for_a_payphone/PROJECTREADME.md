# About the game
"Money for a payphone" is a game made with pygame and it's a game where you walk and talk with the inhabitants of this town in order to earn enough money to utilize a payphone. The gameplay is pretty minimal - consisting of walking and selecting 1 out of 3 dialogue options when conversing with the locals. There are 5 possible endings.

##### Why did I make this game
I was taking an english class, and for my final class project, the professor let us do whatever we want as long as the project's theme is related to the class theme (which was 'family'). So I just focused on the story and made 'talking' the main game mechanic. 

Note: if you run "Money_for_a_payphone_0.5.exe", you can see that at this point my game was unfinished and I was prepared to submit the project in knowing that. However, my professor extended the deadline for everyone and those extra 3 days allowed me to finish the game. **: )**
##### Some technical details
I made this game in python, and used the python libraries: pygame, and pyinstaller. Pygame provided me the framework for the game itself (collision, displaying images, inputs, etc) while Pyinstaller allowed me to export the python file and its assets into one executable file. 

I also mapped out the tile maps via lists of tuples in my code. I could have placed the lists in a different file, but I prefer to keep it all in one file to edit it more easily.

## Credits
I used and had to refer to a lot of resources to make this game.

* __Pygame__ - game library
* __Pyinstaller__ - exporting python file into executable
* __Paget teaches__ - [Link to his youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PagetTeaches/featured "https://www.youtube.com/user/PagetTeaches/featured")
    his pygame youtube series assisted me with getting started with pygame and I utilized one of his algorithms to display animation in a walkcycle
* __Sheep art__ - [Link to the website](http://sheep.art.pl/Tiled%20Map%20in%20PyGame "http://sheep.art.pl/Tiled%20Map%20in%20PyGame")
    his tutorial on how to utilize a tilemap with the pygame library explained the usage of tilemaps, and it helped me to implement a similar algorithm in the code
* __Andrew__ - helped me fix 1 line of code. He was adamant about me giving him credit.
